## Automated Budget Analysis Tool

### Overview
The Automated Budget Analysis Tool is developed to enhance the budget-making process of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM). This tool leverages data analytics and machine learning to provide predictive insights into the impact of various tax regimes on the economy. It aims to automate the currently manual process, improve efficiency, and offer policymakers data-driven visualizations to inform decision-making.

#### Objective
The main objective of this tool is to integrate data analytics into KAM’s research products and advocacy efforts. By automating budget analysis, the tool helps in predicting the outcomes of different tax policies, which aligns with KAM’s goal to streamline its policy-making process.

#### Features
Automated Data Collection and Processing: The tool collects and processes economic, fiscal, and industry-specific data to feed into the analysis.
Predictive Analytics: Utilizes machine learning models to assess the potential impact of different tax regimes on revenue, expenditure, and the broader economy.
Visualization Dashboards: Provides clear and interactive visualizations for policymakers, allowing them to easily interpret the results and make informed decisions.

#### Data Sources
The tool leverages multiple datasets, including:

**Economic and Fiscal Data**: National and regional budgets, tax revenue, public expenditure.

**Tax Regime Data**: Historical and current tax rates, tax base, and policy changes.

**Macroeconomic Indicators**: GDP, inflation rates, unemployment rates.

**Trade Data**: Import/export data, trade agreements impact.

**Industry Data**: Manufacturing output, business registrations.

**KAM-Specific Data**: Reports, member contributions, and industry impact.

## Technologies Used

#### Programming Language: Python

**Libraries**: TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PyMuPDF (Fitz)

**Machine Learning**: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for text summarization and analysis.

**Data Visualization**: Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
